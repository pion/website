I didn&amp;rsquo;t have grand aspirations for the project. It felt important at the time to make WebRTC more accessible. Proprietary alternatives were being proposed and they didn&amp;rsquo;t have technical advantages, they were just easier to use. I enjoyed solving issues one at a time and helping users use Pion.
Interest in WebRTC then exploded in 2020. Lots of new demand for WebRTC software popped up over night.</description></item><item><title>Why WebRTC?</title><link>https://pion.ly/blog/why-webrtc/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pion.ly/blog/why-webrtc/</guid><description>This is a question I get in lots of different forms. Why should I use WebRTC instead of my preferred video protocol? Why does WebRTC need to be in my browser? Why does WebRTC have to be so complicated? Why do you continue to work on WebRTC projects?
These are my answers to the Why&amp;rsquo;s of WebRTC. Lots of nuance exists, and these answers are heavily influenced by the work I do.</description></item></channel></rss>
