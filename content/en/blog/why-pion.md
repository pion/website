'Why would I use Pion' this is the first question we get asked, and it is a great one. It is a hard one to answer, and usually it is different depending on your needs. However it seems to always come down to a few major reasons.

Learning new software is an investment, as developers we know how frustrating it can be when you make the wrong choice. So here is what drives Pion, and why we think you should give us a try.

## Written in Go
Go is the key to our success. If you are a Go developer these all might be old news to you, but if you haven't used Go before you might not know all the perks it offers.

#### Portable
With one command you can compile your Pion application for any supported platform. With one small program you can target FreeBSD, Android, macOS and your Browser (WASM)

#### Simple
The Pion code base was written with simplicity in mind. Any Go developer should be able to read it and just worry about learning WebRTC, not the nuances of the language.

#### Pragmatic
Don't waste time worrying about tooling or formatting. Go solves all of this, worry just about building your great idea.

## Spec Compliance
We try really hard to implement WebRTC correctly. Divergence causes lots of pain, sometimes we make mistakes but our goal is always to implement WebRTC and not 'WebRTC-like'

## Community Owned
Pion is a community owned project, there is no corporation behind it, no BDFL and every developer has an equal vote. We don't have private issues, and our roadmap is driven by our users.

The only thing required to land in master is an approval from another developer. We move fast, and you are never blocked waiting for someone who is on vacation.

We make it a priority to be welcoming to newcomers, and some of our best improvements has been from fresh eyes. We have an active [Slack](../../slack), and try our best to help everyone.

## Diverse Userbase
Our users range from large companies, to startups and lots of hobbyists who are just trying to have fun. Pion is a great tool to build mobile applications, WebRTC servers and everything in between.

If your application involves WebRTC, Pion is designed to fit your needs.

## More Than Just Software
Pion isn't just about building software, but more importantly educating people. Someday better software may come, but hopefully our biggest impact will be creating innovation and hosting a great community.

We are creating a [Knowledge Base](../../knowledge-base/) and documenting everything we learned when building a WebRTC implementation from scratch. We want to pass on everything we learned, we want to see a WebRTC implememntation is every language.

## Re-usable Components
Everything we built is packaged into small blocks. We encourage you to read, learn, fork and improve it! Build interesting things using the same building blocks as WebRTC.
