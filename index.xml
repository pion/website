Why should I use WebRTC instead of my preferred video protocol? Why does WebRTC need to be in my browser? Why does WebRTC have to be so complicated? Why do you continue to work on WebRTC projects?

Lots of nuance exists, and these answers are heavily influenced by the work I do.</description></item><item><title>Contributing</title><link>https://pion.ly/knowledge-base/pion-internals/contributing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pion.ly/knowledge-base/pion-internals/contributing/</guid><description/></item><item><title>FAQ</title><link>https://pion.ly/knowledge-base/pion-basics/faq/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pion.ly/knowledge-base/pion-basics/faq/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Join us on Slack</title><link>https://pion.ly/slack/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pion.ly/slack/</guid><description>Pion has a vibrant community on the Golang Slack.

Learning new software is an investment, as developers we know how frustrating it can be when you make the wrong choice.
The answer is different depending on your needs. However it seems to always come down to a few major reasons. Here is what drives Pion, and why we think you should give us a try.</description></item></channel></rss>
